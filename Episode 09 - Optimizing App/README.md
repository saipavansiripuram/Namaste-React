## Namaste React Course by Akshay Saini

# Episode 09 - Optimizing Our App

## Theory

### Topics Taught

- Custom Hooks
- Modularity in Code
- Modular Bundling
- Code Splitting
- Lazy Loading

## Theory Assignment:

- When and why do we need `lazy()`?
- What is `suspense`?
- Why we got this `error`: A component was suspended while responding to `synchronous input`. This will cause the `UI` to be replaced with a `loading indicator`. To `fix this`, `updates that suspend` should be wrapped with `start transition`? How does `suspense fix` this error?
- `Advantages and Disadvantages` of using this `code splitting pattern`?
- When `do we and why do we need suspense`?

## Coding Assignment:

- Create your `custom hooks`.
- Try out `lazy and suspense`
- Make your `code clean`.
